## 🚀 Purpose
Reading papers is only half the battle; the other half is **making the ideas stick**. This repo is my open notebook:

* **Archive** of influential AI papers (with links to originals or local PDFs when allowed).
* **Annotations & highlights**—key equations, code snippets, and conceptual takeaways in each PDF.

## 🤝 Contributing
This is primarily my personal learning log, but PRs suggesting additional seminal papers, correcting typos, or refining badge scripts are welcome. Open an issue first if the change is substantial.

## ⚖️ License & Copyright
Notes, code, and badge scripts: MIT License (see LICENSE file).
Research papers: Copyright belongs to the original authors and publishers.  Where distribution is restricted, only metadata and personal annotations are provided here—no full‑text PDFs.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
Thanks to the researchers pushing the field forward and to open‑access initiatives like arXiv.
