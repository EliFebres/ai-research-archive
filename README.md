## 🚀 Purpose
Reading papers is only half the battle; the other half is **making the ideas stick**. This repo is my open notebook:

* **Archive** of influential AI papers (with links to originals or local PDFs when allowed).
* **Annotations & highlights**—key equations, code snippets, and conceptual takeaways in each PDF.

## 🤝 Contributing
This is primarily my personal learning log, but PRs suggesting additional seminal papers, correcting typos, or refining badge scripts are welcome. Open an issue first if the change is substantial.

Research papers: Copyright belongs to the original authors and publishers.  Where distribution is restricted, only metadata and personal annotations are provided here—no full‑text PDFs.
